# 3-Year Acquisition Roadmap

_Date: 2026-02-15_

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive 3-year acquisition plan will be developed. It includes a current-state audit (channels, CAC/LTV, funnel conversion, cohorts/retention, attribution, tech stack, team) with fillable templates. We will use benchmarks (SEC filings, analyst reports, CLV models) to set targets. Year-by-year objectives (target segments, value props, pricing/packaging tests) are defined. A 12-quarter roadmap outlines initiatives, owners, budgets (relative and example ranges), KPIs, success criteria, and risk mitigations. We also specify measurement (dashboards, event taxonomy, phased attribution, A/B testing cadence) and hiring/org plans.

## Deliverables
- **PDF** (full report with charts and tables)
- **Markdown (.md)** (complete report + placeholders for chat transcripts)
- **Text (.txt)** (unformatted version)
- **Excel (XLSX):** Budget model & KPI tracker templates
- **PPTX** deck (includes 1-page investor & internal summaries)
- **Images:** 3-year Gantt (Mermaid), funnel flowchart (Mermaid), cohort retention curve, CAC-vs-LTV scenario plot

## Next Steps
1. Insert the two chat transcripts verbatim into the Markdown appendix.
2. Fill the audit template with actual data (leave unspecified items as variables).
3. Collect benchmarks (industry and channel growth rates, unit economics, churn).
4. Define strategic hypotheses by year (target ICPs, messaging experiments, pricing tests).
5. Populate the quarterly roadmap table with initiatives, owners, budgets, KPIs, and mitigations.
6. Design dashboards and event taxonomy; set reporting and A/B test cadence.
7. Plan org hires with roles and gating conditions.
8. Build budget/ROI scenarios (best/likely/worst) in the spreadsheet model.
