# Sports Betting Affiliate + Strategy Platform Blueprint (US-Focused)
_Last updated: 2026-02-15 (America/Chicago)_

> **Disclaimer (read):** This is not legal advice. U.S. sports betting marketing and â€œaffiliateâ€ activity is regulated at the **state** level, and in some jurisdictions affiliates must be registered/licensed as vendors/ancillary service providers. You should validate the compliance plan with gaming counsel and each operatorâ€™s affiliate manager before launch.

## 1) Executive summary (what youâ€™re building)
A **freemium betting strategy + odds intelligence platform** that helps users:
- Explore **current + historical odds**, lines movement, and implied probabilities
- Build and backtest **betting strategies/algorithms**
- Save â€œstrategy templatesâ€ and generate **bet slips** (recommendations) with bankroll rules
- Upgrade to **premium** for deeper data, automation, and collaboration
- Monetize primarily via **affiliate/referral deals** with sportsbooks, then ads + subscriptions

### The big constraint (and how to design around it)
Most regulated U.S. sportsbooks **do not offer open wagering APIs** for consumer apps, and most also prohibit **automated bet placement/bots** on consumer accounts (and/or require written approval).  
**Practical design:** generate *actionable bet slips + deep links* so the user **confirms** bets inside the sportsbookâ€™s own app/site.

## 2) Do DraftKings, FanDuel, and others have affiliate programs?
### Summary table (whatâ€™s public vs gated)
| Operator | Affiliate program exists? | Public application/portal? | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| **FanDuel** | Yes (affiliate portal) | Portal exists, details largely gated | Portal indicates Income Access infrastructure, but the public T&C page appears placeholder. |
| **DraftKings** | Yes (commonly offered via affiliate agreements) | Public details limited | Public-facing DK pages emphasize â€œrefer-a-friendâ€ for customers; affiliate terms/commissions are typically negotiated via partners. |
| **BetMGM** | Yes (**BetMGM Partners**) | Public FAQ/details available | Public help content describes CPA vs RevShare, and licensing requirements for those structures. |
| **Caesars** | Yes (**Caesars Affiliates**) | Public portal + terms + help available | Portal includes help + formal Terms & Conditions. |
| **bet365** | Yes (**bet365 Partners**) | Public portal + help available | Help explicitly mentions website placements and **subscriber-based emails**. |
| **Fanatics Sportsbook** | Not clearly public as an â€œopen affiliateâ€ | No clear public affiliate portal found | Many promo-code partnerships appear publisher-negotiated. |
| **ESPN BET** | Unclear as an open affiliate | No clear public affiliate portal found | May be handled via direct partnerships/media buys rather than open signup. |
| **Hard Rock Bet / Bally Bet / others** | Mixed | Mixed | Many brands use negotiated publisher deals; some â€œaffiliateâ€ pages online are **not** the regulated U.S. operator. Vet carefully. |

## 4) State-by-state compliance map (sports betting + iGaming)
This section is designed to stop you from getting â€œfast rejectedâ€ for promoting in the wrong jurisdictions.

### 4.1 Online sports betting legality snapshot
A reputable, consolidated view is provided by â€œHave A Game Planâ€ and the American Gaming Association (AGA).  
- Have A Game Planâ€™s map summarizes **Live/Legal counts** and provides a downloadable PDF map.  
- AGA provides a â€œLegal Landscapeâ€ state map (note: AGA snapshot page references Feb 27, 2025).

**Sources:**  
- https://www.haveagameplan.org/betting-map/  
- https://www.americangaming.org/research/state-gaming-map/

### 4.2 Known recent change: Missouri is live (Dec 1, 2025)
Multiple sports media outlets report Missouri online sports betting went live **December 1, 2025**.

**Example sources:**  
- FOX Sports update (Feb 10, 2026): https://www.foxsports.com/stories/betting/missouri-sports-betting-2025-launch-updates-sportsbooks  
- SportsLine verification (Feb 12, 2026): https://www.sportsline.com/sportsbooks/missouri

### 4.3 iGaming (online casino) note
Only a subset of states allow full online casino iGaming. Do not assume â€œsports betting legalâ€ == â€œcasino legalâ€.  
(Confirm current iGaming states before any casino-focused SEO/ads.)

## 5) Channel restrictions matrix (to avoid operator + regulator rejections)

> **Important:** These are â€œdefault safeâ€ rules across most regulated programs. Each operator will have its own brand guidelines and may be stricter.

### 5.1 Universal rules (apply to all operators)
- **Geo-fence everything**: state targeting down to eligible states only.
- **Age-gate**: 21+ default (some states are 18+; donâ€™t market 18+ unless youâ€™ve verified state-by-state).
- **No targeting minors**: no youth audiences, no â€œcollege campusâ€ targeting, no cartoons/childish creative.
- **Responsible gambling**: include required RG language and local help line where required.
- **No â€œrisk-freeâ€** phrasing unless the operatorâ€™s approved copy uses it; avoid â€œguaranteed winâ€ claims.
- **No trademark bidding** (SEM) unless you have written permission (common cause of instant rejection).
- **No â€œbonus abuseâ€** content or instructions on exploiting promos.

### 5.2 Operator-by-operator channel matrix (practical defaults)
Legend: âœ… typically allowed (with approval), âš ï¸ common restrictions/approval needed, âŒ usually prohibited.

| Operator | SEO/Content | SEM (Google/Bing) | Paid Social | Influencer | Email | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FanDuel | âœ… | âš ï¸ (brand bidding often restricted) | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | Portal exists; expect strict approval + geo/age gating. |
| DraftKings | âœ… | âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | Separate â€œrefer-a-friendâ€ exists; affiliate deals typically contract-based. |
| BetMGM | âœ… | âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | CPA vs RevShare may require different licensing (public). |
| Caesars | âœ… | âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | No negative carryover; monthly pay (public). |
| bet365 | âœ… | âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | Publicly mentions use in **subscriber-based emails**. |
| Fanatics | âœ… | âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | Often promo-code partnerships; treat as negotiated. |
| ESPN BET | âœ… | âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | âœ…âš ï¸ | âš ï¸ | Likely partnership-heavy; confirm. |

## 6) Product evaluation (is this worth pursuing?)
### The honest take
**Yes, worth pursuing** *if you design it as â€œdecision support + bet slip generation,â€ not auto-betting.*  
If you try to place bets automatically, youâ€™ll hit:
- operator ToS restrictions (botting / automation),
- compliance burdens (KYC, security reviews),
- and significant integration friction (no public wagering APIs).

### Winning wedge
You win by being the best at:
- **backtesting with odds + line movement** (most consumer apps are shallow),
- **explainable â€œedgeâ€ outputs** (why the bet is +EV, not vibes),
- **workflow**: save models â†’ alerts â†’ bet slip â†’ one-click deep link.

---

## 7) Data & API stack (current + historical stats + odds)

### 7.1 Odds
- **The Odds API** offers current + historical odds and publishes transparent pricing tiers.  
  Source: https://the-odds-api.com/  
- Enterprise-grade feeds exist (e.g., **Genius Sports** provides low-latency data + odds feeds).  
  Source: https://www.geniussports.com/bet/odds-feeds-api/

### 7.2 Stats / play-by-play / historical
Enterprise providers (usually paid, licensed):
- **Stats Perform / Opta**: broad live + historical stats via feeds/APIs.  
  Source: https://www.statsperform.com/opta/

You can start MVP with cheaper providers, then graduate to Opta/Sportradar/Genius as you scale.

---

## 8) Architecture (execution-ready)

### 8.1 Core services
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Odds puller (REST/WebSocket where available)
   - Stats puller
   - Normalization + dedupe (team IDs, league IDs, rotations)
2. **Feature Store**
   - Derived features: implied probabilities, vig removal, line movement, rest days, travel, injuries (if licensed)
3. **Strategy Engine**
   - Strategy DSL (rules) + notebook-like experiments
   - Backtesting + walk-forward validation
   - Bankroll mgmt (Kelly fraction variants, unit sizing)
4. **Recommendation Service**
   - Produces bet slips (market, odds, edge %, stake)
   - Explains rationale + sensitivity
5. **Affiliate Routing**
   - â€œWhere to place this betâ€ chooser by state + operator
   - Deep links + tracking
6. **Compliance Layer**
   - Geo + age gating
   - Required disclaimers per state/operator
   - Audit log (what offer shown to whom, where, when)

### 8.2 Suggested tech stack
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI) or Node (NestJS)
- **Data:** Postgres + Timescale (odds time series) + Redis
- **Compute:** workers (Celery/RQ/BullMQ)
- **ML/Backtest:** pandas, numpy, numba; optional Rust for speed
- **Front-end:** Next.js + server actions
- **Auth:** passkeys + OAuth
- **Geo:** vendor (e.g., GeoComply-like approach for â€œwhere user isâ€) + IP fallback (never IP-only for wagering)

## 9) Roadmap (0 â†’ 12 months)

### Phase 0 (Weeks 0â€“2): Compliance + data contract reality check
- Pick 1â€“2 target states to start (e.g., IL, NJ)
- Start affiliate conversations (BetMGM / Caesars / bet365 are easiest to validate publicly)
- Decide your initial odds/stats vendors and budget

### Phase 1 (Weeks 3â€“8): MVP
- Odds + scores + basic line movement charts
- Strategy templates: â€œsteam chaserâ€, â€œclosing line valueâ€, â€œunderdog ML filtersâ€
- Bet slip generator + deep links
- Responsible gambling + geo/age gate

### Phase 2 (Months 3â€“6): Backtesting + alerts
- Historical odds warehouse + backtests
- Alerts: â€œedge > X%â€, â€œline moved Yâ€, â€œinjury changed projectionâ€
- Premium tier launch

### Phase 3 (Months 6â€“12): Scale + moat
- Multi-sport coverage + personalization
- Community strategy marketplace (curated)
- Enterprise-grade data feeds
- Ad inventory + sponsorships

---

## 10) Go-to-market (affiliate-first)
### Acquisition channels that fit regulated reality
- **SEO:** evergreen â€œodds movementâ€, â€œhow to remove vigâ€, â€œCLV trackerâ€
- **YouTube/TikTok (education-first):** model walk-throughs; avoid â€œget rich quickâ€
- **Newsletter:** data-driven picks + explanations (subscriber-based email fits bet365 guidance)
- **Partnerships:** podcasts, analytics communities, fantasy sports tools

### Monetization path
1) Affiliate CPA/RevShare (where allowed + licensed)  
2) Premium subscription (backtesting, alerts, portfolio mgmt)  
3) Ads/sponsorships at scale (be careful with ad network gambling policies)
