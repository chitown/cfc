# Three-Year Launch Customer Acquisition Roadmap + Financial Model Blueprint (Template)

This is an execution-ready **36-month** roadmap + a model template you can adapt.  
Because you did not provide company specifics (ICP, pricing, motion), numbers here are **defaults** meant to be replaced.

## Phase goals

### Year 1 (Months 1â€“12): Prove
- Lock ICP + positioning
- Prove 1â€“2 acquisition channels with repeatable pipeline
- Establish activation + retention baseline
- Instrument attribution + cohort reporting

### Year 2 (Months 13â€“24): Scale
- Scale proven channels
- Build sales + CS playbooks
- Expand 1 adjacent segment/geo
- Improve unit economics (payback trending down)

### Year 3 (Months 25â€“36): Optimize + diversify
- Diversify channels (reduce dependence)
- Improve conversion + retention
- Mature forecasting, prep profitability or fundraise

---

## Roadmap (quarter-by-quarter)

### Q1 (M1â€“M3): Foundation
- 20â€“40 ICP interviews; trigger/pain validation
- Messaging + offer; pricing discovery
- MVP + analytics (events, attribution, cohorts)
- CRM + funnel definitions; baseline reporting

### Q2 (M4â€“M6): Acquisition tests
Run 3â€“5 tests in parallel:
- Paid search (high intent)
- Paid social (retargeting + job-title if B2B)
- Founder-led outbound (tight ICP)
- Content/SEO foundation
- Webinar/community (credibility channel)

### Q3â€“Q4 (M7â€“M12): Prove repeatability
- Pick top 1â€“2 channels by **payback + retention**
- Sales motion: qualification, discovery, close plan
- Onboarding + activation playbooks
- Hire first growth role if signals are strong

### Year 2: Scale what works
- Add SDR/AE capacity only when pipeline coverage is stable
- Add CS when churn/expansion becomes material
- Add partner motion (referral/affiliate) if product fits
- Iterate pricing/package to increase ARPA and reduce churn

### Year 3: Optimize + diversify
- CRO: landing/demo/trial, onboarding, lifecycle
- Improve channel efficiency and mix
- Brand moat: flagship content/report, PR, community
- Forecasting maturity; prep next financing or profitability plan

## Financial model blueprint

### Structure (tabs)
1. Assumptions
2. Channel plan (Spend â†’ Leads â†’ SQL â†’ Opp â†’ Wins)
3. Capacity (SDR/AE ramp caps)
4. Revenue (New MRR + Churn + Expansion)
5. COGS (Gross margin)
6. Opex (Payroll + tools + overhead)
7. Cash (Runway)
8. Scenarios (Base / Opt / Pess)
9. Sensitivity (ACV, win rate, CPL, churn)

### Core formulas
- Leads = Spend / CPL
- SQLs = Leads Ã— Leadâ†’SQL
- Opps = SQLs Ã— SQLâ†’Opp
- Wins = Opps Ã— WinRate
- New MRR = Wins Ã— (ACV/12)
- Churned MRR = Prior MRR Ã— MonthlyChurn
- Ending MRR = Prior MRR + New MRR âˆ’ Churned MRR + ExpansionMRR
- LTV (gross profit) = (ARPA Ã— GrossMargin) / MonthlyChurn
- CAC (lag-adjusted) = Spend_t / Wins_(t+lag)
- Payback (months) â‰ˆ CAC / (ARPA Ã— GrossMargin)

---

## What I need from you to make it â€œrealâ€
- ICP + motion (self-serve vs sales-assisted)
- Pricing/ACV target and gross margin
- Sales cycle (median and P80)
- Target retention (monthly churn or GRR/NRR)
- Channel preferences (paid, outbound, partnerships, etc.)
