## 1. Executive Summary

A sports analytics data product targeting $12K ACV B2B SaaS is a **viable bootstrapped business** — but only with significant restructuring from the original financial model. The market is real (~$2.3B-$5.8B global, growing 15-22% CAGR), the timing thesis is sound (public data access is contracting, creating commercial opportunity), and a solo founder at $1K/month can reach profitability with as few as 3-5 customers.

**The recommended wedge:** College baseball player valuations — the "PFF of college baseball." The gap is clear, the data infrastructure exists, and the transfer portal is creating urgent buyer demand.

**The original financial model describes a funded startup, not a bootstrapped solo founder.** The hiring plan ($40K/month headcount by month 15 against $141K ARR by month 36) must be discarded entirely. The path forward is content-first, founder-led sales, zero hires until profitable.

---

## 2. What This Project Is

Two interconnected workstreams for a sports analytics startup:

1. **Market intelligence** — A 5,000+ word research guide cataloging every significant source of advanced sports tracking data across 11 sports (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, soccer, tennis, golf, MMA, F1, cricket, horse racing). Maps the competitive landscape, identifies data moats, and highlights where commercial opportunity exists.

2. **Go-to-market financial model** — A 36-month customer acquisition roadmap with a working Excel model, three scenario projections, hiring plan, and supporting templates (KPI dashboard, investor slide outline, model formulas).

**The strategic thesis connecting them:** Tracking technology is producing unprecedented amounts of sports data, but public access is contracting. The gap between what exists and what's available creates a commercial opportunity.

### Data Guide Strengths

- Exhaustive source mapping with practical details (pricing tiers, data formats, historical depth, real-time availability, API status, licensing terms)
- Honest about free vs. paid data access
- Timely and specific (FBref/Opta January 2026 data loss documented)
- Cross-sport predictive synthesis (DAKOTA for NFL, xGF% for NHL, strokes gained for golf, etc.)

### Data Guide Gaps

- No competitive landscape for analytics *products* (only data *sources*)
- Missing regulatory and licensing risk quantification
- No user segmentation (who actually buys at $12K ACV?)
- Horse racing and MMA sections are thin

## 3. Market Assessment: Is It Real and Big Enough?

### Global Market Size

| Research Firm | 2025 Estimate | Forecast Target | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|
| MarketsandMarkets | $2.29B | $4.75B by 2030 | 15.7% |
| Grand View Research | ~$4.47B (2024) | $14.48B by 2030 | 20.6% |
| Precedence Research | $5.47B | $29.75B by 2034 | 20.6% |
| Fortune Business Insights | $5.79B | $24.03B by 2032 | 22.5% |

US market: ~$1.73B (2025). North America accounts for 35-42% of the global market.

### Key Players and Revenue

| Company | Revenue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sportradar (NASDAQ: SRAD) | ~$1.35B (2025) | Betting data feeds, live tracking, media |
| Hudl (Private) | ~$730M | 344K+ teams, acquired StatsBomb (2024) |
| Genius Sports (NYSE: GENI) | $655M (2025 guidance) | Owns Second Spectrum ($200M acquisition) |
| Catapult Sports (ASX: CAT) | ~$126M TTM | Wearables + video |
| Zelus Analytics (now Teamworks Intelligence) | ~$15M est. | ML-powered player evaluation |

Top 5 players hold ~35-40% of total market share. The market remains fragmented.

### The $12K ACV Buyer Universe

| Segment | Estimated Buyers | Realistic at $12K ACV |
|---|---|---|
| US Pro Teams (Big 5 leagues) | 154 | Low — these buy enterprise |
| US Pro Teams (minor/affiliate) | ~200 | Medium — budget constrained |
| College D1 | ~350 | **High — best segment** |
| College D2/NAIA | ~550 | Medium — budget dependent |
| US Betting Operators | ~50 | Medium — want data feeds |
| Fantasy Companies | ~75 | Medium |
| Media Companies | ~75 | Low-Medium |
| European Pro Clubs (lower tiers) | ~400 | Medium — localization needed |
| **Total Addressable at $12K ACV** | **~1,100-1,500** | |

**SAM: $13M-$18M.** Enough for a profitable business, not enough for venture-scale returns.

### Verdict

**Real market, narrow.** The mid-market ($5K-$50K ACV) is genuinely underserved — enterprise tools are too expensive, consumer tools are too shallow. StatsBomb proved this segment works ($10M GBP revenue before Hudl acquisition). But $13-18M SAM means this is a lifestyle business or small exit, not a unicorn.

---

## 4. Timing Assessment: Is Now the Right Time?

### Yes — with a critical caveat.

**Evidence that timing is favorable:**

1. **FBref/Opta termination (January 2026):** Opta (Stats Perform) terminated its data agreement with FBref. All advanced soccer statistics removed. The most concrete proof point of public data access contracting.

2. **Leagues reclaiming data rights:** "Historically, many sports outsourced data collection and licensing to third-party platforms, but leagues are now taking a more active role in both data collection and sales to extract greater value" (PwC Sports Outlook 2026).

3. **Data rights becoming equity-level assets:** The share of gross gaming revenues captured by data rights holders ranges from 2% to 25% depending on sport (BCG 2026).

4. **Stats Perform under financial stress:** S&P downgraded Stats Perform's credit rating to CCC in October 2025, citing "material refinancing risk within 12 months." Disruption in the dominant data provider creates opportunity.

5. **NCAA approved expanded tech use in baseball (2025):** Regulatory tailwind for college baseball analytics specifically.

6. **Transfer portal explosion:** Creating urgent demand for player evaluation analytics across all college sports.

7. **Revenue sharing (starting 2025-26):** Capped at ~$20.5M per school, rising 4% annually. Programs now need salary-cap-style analytics they've never needed before.

**The caveat:** This same trend is the biggest structural risk. If your product depends on free data from third parties (stats.nba.com, ESPN undocumented APIs), that supply could evaporate overnight. The timing is right **only if** you build on data sources you control or that are contractually stable.

---

## 5. Fatal Risks

### Fatal Risk 1: Data Supply Dependency

The analysis identifies 5 "best free data sources" (nflfastR, Baseball Savant, CricSheet, FastF1, MoneyPuck). If any follow the FBref/Opta path and restrict access, a product built on them breaks. You don't control the supply chain.

**Mitigation:** Build on data you generate (derived metrics, composite models from public box scores) rather than data you borrow. Baseball Savant/Statcast is the most stable source — MLB has been philosophically committed to open data — but even this isn't guaranteed.

### Fatal Risk 2: Hudl Moves Downmarket

Hudl has 344,000 team relationships and just acquired StatsBomb. If they launch a $10K/year analytics tier for the mid-market, your competitive position evaporates. They have distribution you'd spend years building.

**Mitigation:** Move fast, build a content moat (audience, credibility, brand) that's harder to replicate than features. Hudl is a platform company — they're less likely to build a niche, content-driven player valuation product.

### Fatal Risk 3: The Original Financial Model Doesn't Work for a Solo Founder

The model shows $40K/month in headcount costs by month 15 (SDR + AE + CS) against only $141K ARR by month 36. That's $480K/year payroll against $141K revenue. The model assumes a funded startup, not a bootstrapped solo founder.

**Mitigation:** Throw away the hiring plan entirely. Zero hires until profitable. Founder-led everything.

### Serious but Manageable Risks

- **2% monthly churn** (21.5% annual) is survivable but mediocre. Best-in-class B2B SaaS at this price point achieves <1% monthly. Getting from 2% to 1% roughly doubles effective LTV.
- **The financial model is ~40% complete** — missing P&L, cash flow, CAC, LTV:CAC, and payback period. Can't have an investor conversation or clear self-assessment without these.

---

## 6. Solo Founder Viability

### Key Benchmarks (2025-2026 Data)

| Metric | Reality |
|---|---|
| Time to $100K ARR | 12-24 months from first paying customer (only 12% of indie hackers ever get there) |
| Time to $1M ARR | 3-5 years median for bootstrapped; 2 years top quartile |
| CAC at $12K ACV, founder-led sales | $1,000-$3,000 per customer |
| Infrastructure at $1K/mo | Sufficient for MVP and early production |
| 2% monthly churn assessment | Middle of the pack; survivable, target <1% |
| Customers needed for $1M ARR | ~84 at $12K ACV |
| Sales effort per customer | ~10 hours through the acquisition cycle |

### What $1K/Month Gets You

- Commercial-grade API tiers ($100-300/mo for sports data)
- Managed database (Supabase Pro at $25/mo)
- Proper hosting ($20-50/mo)
- $400-600/mo remaining for tools and small marketing experiments

**At $12K ACV, your first customer pays for an entire year of operations. Second customer onward is gross profit.**

### The StatsBomb Precedent

StatsBomb is the closest comparable: founded as a soccer analytics blog (2013), incorporated as a company (2017), grew to serve 200+ professional teams worldwide, ~$10M GBP annual revenue, acquired by Hudl in 2024. The playbook: content-first (free public analysis) → consulting credibility → paid data product. This is exactly the bootstrapped path.

### "No Sales Team" Is a Fiction

At $12K ACV, buyers expect human touch. "Without a sales team" means you ARE the sales team. Budget accordingly: at 84 customers needed for $1M ARR, if each takes 10 hours of founder sales effort, that's 840 hours/year (~5 months of full-time sales work).

## 7. Sport Selection: Why College Baseball

### Comparative Scorecard

| Factor | Baseball | Football | Basketball | Soccer |
|--------|----------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Free data quality** | Best in any sport (Statcast/Savant) | Thin at college level | Very thin | Just collapsed (FBref/Opta) |
| **Data infra in buyers' hands** | TrackMan 300+ colleges, Rapsodo 90%+ D1 | Hudl video only | Synergy (locked behind Sportradar) | Fragmented |
| **Clear competitive gap** | No "PFF of college baseball" exists | PFF + Teamworks dominate | EvanMiya partially fills it | StatsBomb acquired, gap reopening |
| **Buyer count at $12K ACV** | ~300 D1 programs | ~130 FBS (saturated) | ~350 D1 programs | Small US college market |
| **Content-first path** | Clear (draft analysis, portal rankings) | Crowded content market | Moderate | Possible but niche |
| **Regulatory tailwind** | NCAA expanded tech approval (2025) | Stable | Stable | N/A |
| **Budget competition from NIL** | Lower (baseball NIL is smaller) | Severe (draining tech budgets) | Moderate | Minimal |

### The Gap

Research finding: *"Player valuation models for college baseball — comparable to what PFF provides for football or EvanMiya for basketball — are still nascent."*

College baseball coaches have TrackMan and Rapsodo generating mountains of raw data (spin rates, exit velocities, launch angles, movement profiles). But nobody is synthesizing that data into **composite player valuations**. That's the product.

### Why Baseball Wins

1. **Best free data in any sport.** Baseball Savant/Statcast is the gold standard. MLB has been philosophically committed to open data. Most stable data foundation available.

2. **Data infrastructure already exists at buyers' locations.** 300+ colleges have TrackMan, 90%+ of D1 programs have Rapsodo. Programs are *generating* data they can't fully use. Your product turns their existing data into actionable intelligence.

3. **Transfer portal is the demand engine.** College baseball's transfer portal is exploding. Coaches need to evaluate hundreds of candidates quickly with limited staff. A composite player score combining public performance data with tracking metrics solves an immediate, painful problem.

4. **No dominant incumbent in this specific niche.** PFF owns football grading. EvanMiya partially owns basketball rankings. Nobody owns college baseball player valuations.

5. **NCAA regulatory tailwind.** The NCAA approved expanded use of tracking technology in conference baseball games for the 2025 season. The sport is actively embracing analytics.

6. **Content-first path is natural.** Publish free transfer portal rankings and player valuations → build audience on baseball analytics Twitter → gate detailed profiles behind subscription. This is the exact StatsBomb playbook.

7. **NIL budget pressure is lower.** College baseball NIL deals are smaller than football/basketball, so tech budgets are less cannibalized.

### Why Not the Others

**Football:** PFF grades every play of every FBS game. Teamworks Intelligence ($1B+ valuation) has ML-powered player evaluation and 99% D1 penetration. NIL is actively cannibalizing tech budgets — one program suspended its entire $300K tech budget to fund NIL. Most saturated, hardest to break into.

**Basketball:** EvanMiya already exists as a solo-founder player valuation product. Synergy Sports (Sportradar) has mandatory conference-level contracts. The gap is partially filled.

**Soccer:** FBref/Opta collapse creates theoretical opportunity, but data access got *worse*, not better. StatsBomb was just acquired by Hudl — they'll fill the gap with enterprise resources a solo founder can't match. Small US college market.

### College Athletics Market Context

| Segment | Analytics Spending | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Power Four football programs | $1M-$3M+/year (staff + tools + hardware) | Alabama spends $1M+ on analysts alone |
| Mid-tier Power Four | $300K-$800K/year | One program suspended $300K tech budget for NIL |
| Group of Five programs | $50K-$200K/year | 1 person wearing multiple hats |
| College baseball programs | Rapidly growing | TrackMan ($25K install), Rapsodo ($3K) widely adopted |

**Key insight:** The resource disparity creates the opportunity. Programs spending $50K-$200K on tech can't afford enterprise tools (Catapult at ~$100K/year, Teamworks Intelligence pricing not public) but need more than spreadsheets. A $12K/year subscription is noise in even a modest athletic department budget.

---

## 8. Go/No-Go Recommendation

### **Conditional GO**

The market is real, the timing thesis is sound, the data guide is strong research, and the college baseball gap is clear. At $1K/month burn, one customer covers annual infrastructure costs.

### Conditions for GO

1. **Pick ONE sport (college baseball) and ONE buyer segment (D1 programs).** Don't boil the ocean across 11 sports.

2. **Start with content, not product.** Publish player valuations and transfer portal analysis. Build audience and credibility before charging money.

3. **Throw away the hiring plan.** Zero labor costs until revenue covers it. Founder-led everything.

4. **Build on data you generate, not data you borrow.** Derived metrics, composite models from public data, proprietary valuation algorithms. Don't depend on any single third-party data source that could be revoked.

5. **Keep the $12K ACV.** At $1K/month burn, you don't need volume — you need 5-10 customers who pay well and stick around. Higher ACV means fewer, deeper customer relationships, which is what a solo founder can manage.

---

## 9. The 6-Month Path

### Months 1-2: Build the Model

- Ingest Statcast + college baseball public data (pybaseball, NCAA stats)
- Create composite player valuation scores (pitchers and hitters)
- Ship a free public website with transfer portal rankings
- **Output:** Live website with player valuations, updated weekly

### Months 3-4: Build the Audience

- Publish weekly content (portal analysis, draft projections, player comps)
- Build audience on baseball Twitter / analytics community
- Cold outreach to 5-10 college coaches using the free tool as the hook
- Collect feedback, iterate on what coaches actually want to see
- **Output:** Growing audience, early coach relationships, validated product direction

### Months 5-6: Monetize

- Gate detailed player profiles, historical comps, team-level scouting reports, and batch export behind a $1K/month subscription ($12K ACV)
- First 3-5 customers come from coaches who already use the free tool
- **Output:** First paying customers, self-sustaining unit economics

### Key Milestones

| Milestone | Target | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| Free tool live | Month 2 | Proves you can build it |
| First 100 weekly active users | Month 4 | Proves audience exists |
| First paying customer | Month 5-6 | Proves willingness to pay |
| 5 paying customers | Month 8-10 | Self-sustaining business ($60K ARR) |
| 10 paying customers | Month 12-15 | Real business ($120K ARR) |

## 10. Budget Breakdown

### Monthly Infrastructure ($1K/month)

| Component | Tool | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Database (player stats, valuations) | Supabase Pro | $25 |
| Web app hosting | Vercel Pro | $20 |
| Background jobs (data ingestion) | Railway | $10-20 |
| Baseball data ingestion | pybaseball (free) + custom scrapers | $0 |
| Email/auth | Built into Supabase | $0 |
| Domain + DNS | Cloudflare | $10 |
| Analytics | PostHog free tier | $0 |
| SEO/content tools | Buffer or similar | $15 |
| **Active spend** | | **~$100-200** |
| **Reserve for API upgrades** | | **~$800** |
| **Total** | | **$1,000** |

### Cost Trajectory

| Stage | Monthly Cost | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-revenue (months 1-5) | $100-200 | MVP + free tool |
| First customers (months 6-12) | $200-500 | Upgrade to commercial API tiers, more compute |
| At $100K ARR | $300-800 | Scale data ingestion, possibly premium data feeds |
| At $1M ARR | $3,000-5,000 | Industry benchmark: ~5% of ARR on infrastructure |

### Unit Economics at $12K ACV

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ACV | $12,000 | |
| Gross margin | ~85-90% | Higher than original 75% estimate because infrastructure costs are minimal |
| CAC (founder-led) | $1,000-3,000 | Content + founder sales, no paid acquisition |
| LTV (at 2% monthly churn) | ~$50,000 | Average customer lifetime: ~4.2 years |
| LTV:CAC ratio | 17-50x | Extremely healthy |
| Payback period | <1 month | First month's payment covers CAC |
| Customers for $100K ARR | ~9 | |
| Customers for $1M ARR | ~84 | |

---

## 11. Financial Model Gaps to Fix

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Fix the customers_end column** in all three scenario sheets. Fractional wins accumulating into MRR while customer count shows 0 will confuse any reader.

2. **Add an explicit CPL assumption** to the assumptions sheet. Implied at ~$120 but not stated.

3. **Build the P&L / cash flow tab.** Wire hiring plan costs into monthly opex, combine with marketing spend, subtract from revenue, show monthly burn and cumulative cash position. Most important missing piece.

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

4. **Compute CAC, LTV, payback, and LTV:CAC** in the model. Formulas are documented in model_structure_and_formulas.md — they just need to be implemented.

5. **Add a TAM/SAM/SOM estimate.** Use the buyer universe data from this evaluation. College baseball D1 programs: ~300 buyers x $12K = $3.6M SAM for the initial wedge.

6. **Quantify the sensitivity analysis.** Replace "ARR decreases" with actual dollar figures showing ARR at +/-20% for each parameter.

### Medium-Term (Next Month)

7. **Add a competitive landscape section** to the data guide. Map existing commercial products in each sport.

8. **Wire cohort data into projections.** Model retention by acquisition cohort rather than flat 2% churn on total MRR.

9. **Split channel spend** in the model. Even 2-3 channels with different CPLs and conversion rates.

10. **Add expansion revenue line.** Usage-based pricing or tier upgrades change LTV significantly.

## Caveat: Domain Expertise Override

This recommendation assumes no deep domain expertise in a different sport. If you are a former college football coach, a lifelong soccer analyst, or have deep credibility in another sport, **domain expertise matters more than the data advantage.**

The best sport is the one where you can credibly publish analysis that coaches trust. A baseball outsider publishing player valuations will struggle to gain credibility. A football insider with PFF-level knowledge publishing football analysis will outperform a "better on paper" baseball play every time.

**If you have a sports background that points in a different direction, say so — the analysis framework holds, but the sport selection would change.**
